### Hi my friend 👋 Welcome my Github 🎉

I am 245 years old and a student from Silvershimmer, if you don't know Silvershimmer, fine! Because it is in luna🌕 and is the capital🏰 of luna, it is normal for Earthlings not to understand.

Because I am not from the earth, nor english people, so my English is not very good, please forgive me. But I'm good at Chinese, because Chinese is our official language 🗣.

😺😸😹😻😼😽🙀😿😾
